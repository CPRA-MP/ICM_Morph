# ICM_Morph v24.0.0 Release Notes

This release, v24.0.0, made the following updates to ICM-Morph v23.3.1:<br>
1. Previously, when determining whether a given marsh edge pixel was eligible for edge erosion during a given model year, a `CEILING` function was used when converting the annual edge erosion rate (meters/year) to the model year in which that rate would result in an eroded pixel. For example, an edge retreat rate of 4.9 m/yr would require 6.12 years to erode one 30-meter pixel of marsh edge. The `CEILING` function would result in edge erosion of that pixel to occur in model year 7. This update, now uses `NINT` (Fortran's intrinsic rounding function) for this calculation, instead of `CEILING`. Therefore, for the same example, the pixel will now be lost due to edge erosion in model year 6, instead of model year 7.
2. Previously, the surface elevation of eroded edge pixel was lowered by a set amount the year in which it was eroded. The magnitude of this lowering was passed into the model via **input_params.csv** as the variable `me_lowerDepth_m` (a value of 0.25-m was used for all simulations conducted for the 2023 Coastal Master Plan). This code update, instead of using a pre-set value, now updates the elevation of an eroded pixel to be equal to the elevation of the nearest water body bottom. This change was implemented due to an analysis in which it was seen that previously eroded edge pixels were set higher than nearby water bodies (e.g., the original depth was noticeably greater than the 0.25-m value used). This would result in the occasional edge pixel to pop-up as land gain in later years due to an unreasbonably shallow depth assumption. <br>
